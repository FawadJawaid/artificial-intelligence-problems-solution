There is some correction on the assginment no. 1, 

We call them ABCD, having height 10, 5, 1, 2 then there will be an optimal solution for the transportation trip that will take 17 units of time in total, and consists of following trips. 

1.    C and D will go first it will take 2 unit of time. 
2.    C will come back; it will take 1 unit of time. 
3.    B and C will go in the second trip, it will take 5 unit of time. 
4.    C will come back; it will take again 1 unit of time. 
5.    A and C will go in the third trip, it will take 10 unit of time.  
Adding all of them 2+1+10+2+2 =17 

You need to find the optimal unit of time in all cases. Hence, the outoutfile contains 17 units instead of 19. 

There is one more correction, There are 10 planets that are participating in the meeting. Each one is represented by English alphabet, staring from A to J. The height of each species 10,5,1,2,6,7,3,4,4,and 5 respectively. 

2, 1 gaya = 2
1 wapis
1, 5, 10
5, 1 gaya =2+5
1 wapis
1, 10
1, 10 gaya = 2+5+10
