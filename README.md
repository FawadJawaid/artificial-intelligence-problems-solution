This is the artificial intelligence problem solving project. This work has been done during the course of Artificial Intelligence in my bachelors degree. There are three problems in this project; United Federation of Planets (UFP),  Rajuâ€™s Patterns  and 8-Puzzle which have been solved through AI algorithms.
