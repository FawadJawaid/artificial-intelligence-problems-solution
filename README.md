# Artificial Intelligence Problems Solution
This is the artificial intelligence problem solving project. This work has been done during the course of Artificial Intelligence in my bachelors degree. There are three problems in this project; United Federation of Planets (UFP),  Rajuâ€™s Patterns  and 8-Puzzle which have been solved through AI algorithms.

The description of the each problem can be seen in **AI_Assignment_1.pdf** document.

- *CS401-K112116-A1P1.cpp* refers to problem 1 solution.
- *CS401-K112116-A1P2.cpp* refers to problem 2 solution.
- *CS401-K112116-A1P3.cpp* refers to problem 3 solution.
